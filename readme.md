## ST CubeMX
Various projects build from STM's CubeMX tool. Most projects will be built for IAR WEARM 8.4

### Note:
CubeMX generated code may be copyright (c) STMicroelectronics.

## AdaFruit_LCD_SD_joystick
example project using AdaFruit LC DSD joystick shield on a STM32 Nucleo-L073RZ.

## DMX test uart
a CubeMX test project to configure the USART for DMX512's required baud rate (250000)

## L073RZ_blinky
example project to blink the LED on a STM32 Nucleo-L073RZ.
This project exists to create code to integrate into my STM32 LoRa projects based on the P-Nucleo-LRWAN
(Nucleo-L073RZ + SX1272MB2xAS embed shield.) See  https://github.com/markr1961/ST_LoRa
