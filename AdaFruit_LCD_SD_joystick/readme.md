[blog:  Adafruit 1.8 18-bit Color TFT Shield w/microSD and Joystick](https://blog.adafruit.com/2012/04/26/new-product-adafruit-1-8-18-bit-color-tft-shield-wmicrosd-and-joystick/)  
This lovely little shield is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project. We took our popular 1.8″ TFT breakout board and remixed it into an Arduino shield complete with microSD card slot and a 5-way joystick navigation switch (with a nice plastic knob)! Since the display uses only 4 pins to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used easily to add a display & interface without exhausting the memory or pins.
##### Specifications:
1.8″ diagonal LCD TFT display  
128×160 resolution, 18-bit (262,144) color  
ST7735R (datasheet) controller with built in pixel-addressable video RAM buffer  
4 wire SPI digital interface  
Built-in microSD slot – uses 2 more digital lines  
5V compatible! Use with 3.3V or 5V logic Arduinos  
Onboard 3.3V @ 150mA LDO regulator  
2 white LED backlight, transistor connected. Defaults to ‘on’ but can be connected to a digital pin for PWM or simply turning off  
Comes with header, requires soldering!  

There is an example project in CubeMX for L073 and the binary demonstration files are available from the STM32L073RZ-Nucleo page in the Binary Resources section. see: https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l073rz.html
